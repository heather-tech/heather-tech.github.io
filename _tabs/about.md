My name is Heather Kruszewski. I currently live in the United States with my little family with plans to move to Europe after completing the Software Engineering program at Flatiron. 

I discovered coding around November of 2022. I initially fell in love with the idea of the money and being able to work from home. I slowly started looking in to it and teaching myself little by little. Needless to say, I fell in **LOVE** with coding *very* quickly! 

It never fails to excite me when a project comes together or when I find that one piece in the code that was causing all of the issues.
