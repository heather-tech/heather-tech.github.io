# Phase-2 Let's Talk About React Router
---
## What is Client-Side Routing?

- **Client-Side Routing** - handle all the routing logic with JavaScript, without additional GET requests for some new HTML document
- **Single-Page Application (SPA)** - one HTML document for entire app
- The server is not responsible for handling the routing, fetching, and displaying. The client-side is the responsible

## Are There Any Limitations?
- First page can take a longer time to load is the app is big
- SPA doesn't have pages, in the traditional sense, which makes it harder for analytical tools to track page views
- Harder to design compared to multi-page applications

## What is React Router?
- **React Router** - a JavaScript framework that lets us handle client and server-side routing
    - Reacts' most popular client-side routing library

### Core Features

- Conditional rendering of components based on URL
    - When URL is `/home`, the `<Home>` component is displayed
- Programmatic navigation using JavaScript
    - When the home page link is click, URL changes to `/home` and content is updated without making a new request for a new HTML
- All of the features of React Router build on top of other features that are already built into JavaScript via different web APIs, like location and history
    - **Location API**
        - `window.location;` - returns **location** object with useful info about the current page
    - **Window API**
        - `window.history;` - returns how many locations you have visited in this **window** session
        - `window.history.back();` - takes you to last location
        - `window.history.forward();` - takes you forward 
        - `window.history.pushState();` - programmatically navigate to a new page

## How To Use React Router 
This example is from [React Router Docs](https://v5.reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start).

- First, install `create-react-app` to make a new project

``` 
npm create-react-app my-app 
cd my-app
```

- Next, install React Router
    - In this example, we are using `react-router-dom` since we are building a web app

```
npm add react-router-dom
```

- 3 pages are handled by the router
    - Home
    - About
    - Users
- As you click on the `<Link>`s, the router renders the matching `<Route>`

## 3 Primary Components

- Routers
    - `<BrowserRouter>`
        - Uses regular URL paths
        - Your web server needs to serve the same page at all URLs that are managed client-side by React Router
    - `<HashRouter>`
        - Stores the current location in the hash portion of the URL 
    - ***Differences*** - the way they store the URL and communicate with your web server

![Routers Example](/assets/img/import.png)

- Router Matchers
    - `<Switch>`  **No longer used in v6**
        - When `<Switch>` is rendered, it searches through its children (`<Route>`) elements to find and match its path with the current URL
    - `<Routes>`
        - Replaced `<Switch>`
    - `<Route>`
        - This element's props are read to create a **route** by `<Routes>`

![Routes Example](/assets/img/routes.png)

- Navigation / Route Changers
    - `<Link>`
        - Creates links in your application

    ![Link Example](/assets/img/link.png)



    - `<Navigation>`
        - A superset of `<Link>`, adding styling attributes to a rendered element when it matches the current URL 

    ![Navigation Example](/assets/img/navigation.png)

    - `<Redirect>`
        -Forces navigation
