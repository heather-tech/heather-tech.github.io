# Phase-2 Let's Talk About React Router

![React Router](/assets/img/firstpic.png)

## What is Client-Side Routing?

- **Client Side Routing** - handles all the routing logic with JavaScript, without additional GET requests for some new HTML document
- **Single-Page Application (SPA)** - one HTML document for the entire app
- The server is not responsible for handling the routing, fetching, and displaying. The client side is responsible
- This enables faster user experiences because the browser doesn't need to request an entirely new document
- Also enables a more dynamic user experience with things like animation 
## Are There Any Limitations?
- The first page can take a longer time to load if the app is big
- SPA doesn't have pages, in the traditional sense, which makes it harder for analytical tools to track page views
- Harder to design compared to multi-page applications

## What is React Router?
- **React Router** - a JavaScript framework that lets us handle client and server-side routing
    - Reacts' most popular client-side routing library

### Core Features

- Conditional rendering of components based on URL
    - When the URL is `/home`, the `<Home>` component is displayed
- Programmatic navigation using JavaScript
    - When the home page link is clicked, the URL changes to `/home`, and content is updated without making a new request for a new HTML
- All of the features of React Router build on top of other features that are already built into JavaScript via different web APIs, like location and history
    - **Location API**
        - `window.location;` - returns **location** object with useful info about the current page
    - **Window API**
        - `window.history;` - returns how many locations you have visited in this **window** session
        - `window.history.back();` - takes you to last location
        - `window.history.forward();` - takes you forward 
        - `window.history.pushState();` - programmatically navigate to a new page

## How To Use React Router 
This example is from [React Router Docs](https://v5.reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start).

- First, install `create-react-app` to make a new project

``` 
npm create-react-app my-app 
cd my-app
```

- Next, install React Router
    - In this example, we are using `react-router-dom` since we are building a web app

```
npm add react-router-dom
```

- 3 pages are handled by the router
    - Home
    - About
    - Users
- As you click on the `<Link>`s, the router renders the matching `<Route>`

## 3 Primary Components

- Routers (Currently Does Not Support Data APIs)
    - `<BrowserRouter>`
        - Uses regular URL paths
        - Your web server needs to serve the same page at all URLs that are managed client-side by React Router
    - `<HashRouter>`
        - Stores the current location in the hash portion of the URL 
    - ***Differences*** - the way they store the URL and communicate with your web server

![Routers Example](/assets/img/import.png)

- Router Matchers 
    - `<Switch>`  **No longer used in v6**
        - When `<Switch>` is rendered, it searches through its children (`<Route>`) elements to find and match its path with the current URL
    - `<Routes>`
        - Replaced `<Switch>`
    - `<Route>`
        - This element's props are read to create a **route** by `<Routes>`
    - More on routes below

![Routes Example](/assets/img/routes.png)

- Navigation / Route Changers
    - `<Link>`
        - Creates links in your application

    ![Link Example](/assets/img/link.png)



    - `<NavLink>`
        - A superset of `<Link>`, adding styling attributes to a rendered element when it matches the current URL 

    ![NavLink Example](/assets/img/navlink.png)

    - `<Redirect>`
        - Forces navigation

    ![Redirect Example](/assets/img/redirect.png)

## Picking a Router - Supports the new data APIs

- `createBrowserRouter`
    - It uses the DOM History API to update the URL and manage the history stack

- `createHashRouter`
    - Instead of using normal URLs, it will use the hash portion of the URL to manage the "application URL"

- ***History Stack*** - As the user navigates, the browser keeps track of each location in a stack
## Nested Routes 

- ***Nested Routes***
    - Allows multiple components to render on the same page 
    - Defines routes in a hierarchical manner - a single URL can match multiples routes in a nested branch of the tree
        - A parent route can have child routes
            - Each child route represents a portion of the URL

## Routes, Route, Switch

- `<Routes>` 
    - Whenever the location changes it looks through all its child routes to find the best match and renders that branch of the UI
    - Outermost component 
    - Wraps multiple `<Route>` components
- `<Route>`
    - The `<Route>` component takes in a `path` and `element` prop
    - The `path` value holds the route path
    - The `element` value holds a pointer to a component or a page
- `<Switch>`
    - Has nested Route components that need exact paths
    - Renders the first child `<Route>` that matches the location

## What Are Hooks?
- **Hooks** - Allow access to state of the router and perform navigation from inside of the components
    - `useHistory` 
        - Access to the history
    - `useLocation`
        - Returns the location object that represents the current URL
    - `useParams`
        - Returns an object of key/value pairs of URL parameters
    - `useRouteMatch`
        - Attempts to match the current URL in the same way that a <Route> would
### What About Errors?

- Most errors are handled automatically by React Router
