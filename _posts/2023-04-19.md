# A Study Guide For JavaScript 

## The Basics

- **Variables**
    - Container in which we can store values for later retrieval
        - **let**
            - Can't redeclare a variable, but can reassign the value
        - **const**
            - Cannot be redeclared or reassigned
            - Must assign value right away
        - **var**
            - Can be redeclared and reassigned without warning
            - Avoid 

- **Operators**
    - Operators do not need parentheses
        - `+`
        - `!`
        - `<=`
        - `typeof`

- **Logical Operators**
    - Used to evaluate boolean expressions
        - `!` NOT
        - `&&` AND
        - `||` OR

| Left Side   | Right Side           | Return Value  | Truthiness or Return Value |
| :---:       |    :----:            |         :---: | :---:                      |
| Falsey      | Doesn't Matter       | Left Side     | Falsey                     |
| Truthy      | Falsey               | Right Side    | Falsey                     |
| Truthy      | Truthy               | Right Side    | Truthy                     |


## Basic Data Types 

- **Numbers**
    - Only has a single, all-encompassing number type

- **Strings**
    - Matching pair of `' '` , `" "` , `` ` ` `` with zero or more characters in between
    - Empty strings are strings `" "` 
    - `" "` and `' '` used interchangeably

- **Boolean**
    - Can only be `True` or `False`
    - Plays a big role in `if` statements and looping

- **Objects**
    - Collection of data rather than a single value
    - Consists of a list of properties wrapped in curly braces `{ }` and separated by commas
    - Each property in the list consists of a key-which points to a value
    <!-- -  key : value -->
    - Objects properties can point to values of any data type 


- **Arrays**
    - Technically not a data type in JavaScript
    - Special case of the object data type
    - Displays objects
    - List of values enclosed in square brackets `["Reid", "Harper"]`
        - Values can be of any data type

- **Null**
    - Represents intentionally absent objects

- **Undefined**
    - Means "not yet assigned a value"

- 6 out of 7 are **primitive data types** meaning they represent single values
    - Object is not a primitive data type
    - Examples: 7, "hello", false

## Strings

- **Interpolation**
    - Process of injecting the value of an expression into a string

- **Interpolation Operator** `${}`
    - Any expression/statement that returns a value can be used

- `+` when placed between two strings, it joins them and returns a new string

- By using backticks and the interpolation operator, we are telling JavaScript to:
    - Interpret the expression inside the `${}`
    - Convert it to a string
    - Insert it into our string

- When to use `+` vs. `${}`
    - General Rule
        - String = simple & short
            - `+` may be cleaner
        - String = complex 
            - Use `${}` 
## Equality Operators

- **strict equality operator** `===`
    - Returns true if two values are equal without performing conversions
- **strict inequality operator** `!==`
    - Returns true if two values are not equal without performing type conversions
    -EXAMPLE
- **loose equality operator** `==`
    - Returns true if two values are equal
- **loose inequality operator** `!=`
    - Returns true if two values are not equal
    - Opposite of `==`
- For comparisons use `===` and `!==`

## Scope

- **Scope**-what we access and where we can access it
    - **Global**
        - Accessible in every scope
        - Cannot access function or block scope
    - **Function**
        - Accessible within a function
        - Specific to a single function
        - Can't be accessed by anything in outer scopes
    - **Block**
        - Accessible within a block
        - A variable declared with **let** or **const** is only available within the block of code in which it is declared
        - Can't be accessed by anything in outer scopes

## DOM Manipulation

- DOM Programming consists of using JavaScript to:
    - Ask the DOM to find or select an HTML element or elements in the rendered page
    - Remove and/or insert one or more elements
    - Adjust a property of selected element(s)
        - Can use DOM programming to create and modify content that users see in their browsers and add interactivity to our web pages
            - Only changes what the user sees
                - Underlying code is **not** changed
            - Page goes back to its original state once refreshed
- **Nodes**
    - Objects in the DOM that consist of tags
    - Nodes & elements are NOT the same 
    - All elements in the DOM are nodes, NOT all nodes are HTML elements

### The Structure of DOM Content

- DOM Nodes often have a starting tag and an ending tag
    - `<p>` paragraph `</p>`
    - `<main>` main section `</main>`
- Can nest other nodes inside if it has a starting and ending tag
    - **Child node**
        - Inner node
    - **Parent node**
        - Outer node

- **Self-Closing Elements** / **Void Elements**
    - Only have a starting tag
    - Void elements do NOT have any content nested inside of them and cannot be parent nodes

``` 
<img src="https://example.gif" 
        alt="example gif"/> 
```

### Grab the DOM

- `document.querySelector`
    - Returns the first element that matches the specified CSS selector
- `document.querySelectorAll`
    - Returns a list of all elements that match the specified CSS selector
- `document.getElementById`
    - Returns the element that matches the specified ID
- `document.createElement`
    - Creates a new element with a specified tagName
- **Event Listeners**-A function that is triggered/called when the specified event occurs
    - A Few Possible Events
        - Mouse Events
        - Keyboard Events
        - Touch

##  Communication is Key

- **API**-application programming interface is a way for companies and organizations to expose their data to the public for use

- **JSON**-JavaScript object notation commonly used for transmitting data in web applications 

- **Fetch**-starts a request and returns a promise
    - Function that retrieves data
        - **Promise**
            - **Pending**-Initial state, before the promise succeeds or fails
            - **Resolved**-Completed promise
            - **Rejected**-Failed promise
### Asynchronous Vs. Synchronous

- **Asynchronous**-code allows other code to run while the request is being made
- **Synchronous**-code blocks the execution of other code until the request is completed


## Loops and Iterations

- **`.map()`**-used to create a new array by using an existing array and applying a function to each element of the array

```
const array1 = [1, 4, 9, 16];

// Pass a function to map
const map1 = array1.map(x => x * 2);

console.log(map1);
// Expected output: Array [2, 8, 18, 32]
```

- **`.forEach()`**-used to iterate over an array and execute a function on each element of the array

```
const array1 = ['a', 'b', 'c'];

array1.forEach(element => console.log(element));

// Expected output: "a"
// Expected output: "b"
// Expected output: "c"

```

- **`.filter()`**-used to apply a specific condition to an array or collection and return a new array that contains only the elements that meet that condition
    - Enables us to write less repetitive code
```
const words = ['spray', 'limit', 'elite', 'exuberant', 'destruction', 'present'];

const result = words.filter(word => word.length > 6);

console.log(result);
// Expected output: Array ["exuberant", "destruction", "present"]
```
- **`.find()`**-used to get the value of the first element in the array that satisfies the provided condition
    - If no element satisfies the condition, it returns undefined
```
const array1 = [5, 12, 8, 130, 44];

const found = array1.find(element => element > 10);

console.log(found);
// Expected output: 12
```
- **`for...in`**-loop is used to iterate over the enumerable properties of an object
    - Iterates over the keys of the object, and you can access the corresponding value using the square bracket notation

- **`for...of`**-loop is used to iterate over the values of an iterable object, such as an array or a string
    - Iterates over the values of the array
    - Can access each value directly

## Functions Vs. Arrow Functions

- **Function**-an object that contains statements that can be executed or called multiple times
```
const getRectArea = function(width, height) {
  return width * height;
};

console.log(getRectArea(3, 4));
// Expected output: 12
```
- **Arrow function**-shorthand way to declare functions
    - Does not require `function` keyword
    - No `{ }` = implicit return
        - Does not require `return` keyword
    - One parameter = `( )` become optional
```
const materials = [
  'Hydrogen',
  'Helium',
  'Lithium',
  'Beryllium'
];

console.log(materials.map(material => material.length));
// Expected output: Array [8, 6, 7, 9]
```
## Callbacks

- **Callback function**-a function passed into another function as an asrgument, then invoked inside the outer function to complete an action

Below is a synchronous callback. It is executed immediately.
```
function greeting(name) {
  alert(`Hello, ${name}`);
}

function processUserInput(callback) {
  const name = prompt("Please enter your name.");
  callback(name);
}

processUserInput(greeting);
```
