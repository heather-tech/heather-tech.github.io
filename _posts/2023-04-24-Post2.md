# All About JSON

![Coding](https://learnandbuild.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/pre_c-program-2.jpg)

<br>

When it came time to create my first project, I was going in so many different directions before finally landing on creating something to do with books. I opted to create my own JSON file to focus on areas that are of extreme importance to me. While doing so, I realized how much I enjoyed creating it. I was able to choose what data put into my file and then I could pull that data to my project. 

<br>

## JSON (**J**ava**S**cript **O**bject **N**otation)

<br>

[MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/JSON "JSON") provides the following definition: "JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is a standard text-based format for representing structured data based on JavaScript object syntax. It is commonly used for transmitting data in web applications (e.g., sending some data from the server to the client, so it can be displayed on a web page, or vice versa)." 

- Breakdown:
    - Easy to read and understand
    - Often used when data is sent from a server to a web page
    - Lightweight format for storing and transporting data
    - Similar to JavaScript objects-easily convert JSON data into JavaScript objects

- ***`JSON.parse()`***-converts JSON strings into JavaScript objects
- ***`JSON.stringify()`***-converts an object into a JSON string

<br>

## JSON Types

<br>
Below are some examples of JSON data types. 

1. Strings
    1. `"Hello"`
    2. `'Hi'`
2. Numbers
    1. 7
    2. 13
3. Booleans
    1. true
    2. false
4. null
    1. null
5. Arrays
    1. `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
    2. `["Hello", "Hi"]`
6. Objects
    1. `{"key" : "value"}`
    2. `{"name" : "Reid"}`
    
<br>

## How To Create A JSON File

<br>

1. Open your text editor.

2. Create the JSON file. You can name it like I did in the first example or use the second example.
    <br>
    `db.json`
    <br>
    `filename.json`

3. Type curly braces.


    ```{ }```

4. Inside of the curly braces, type your data to make your object. Each `"key" : "value",` must be encased in double quotes and a comma after to enable more data to be added below.
    - Below is a very basic example.


    ```
    {
    "name" : "Reid",

    "favoriteColor" : "Green",

    "hasPets" : true,

    "petNames" : ["Milo", "Rush", "Ivy"]
    }
    ```

5. The last set of data does not need a comma at the end. 

### Rules

1. Curly braces hold objects

2. Square brackets hold arrays

3. Keys/Names must be surrounded by double quotes

4. Data is in key/value pairs

## Retrieve The Data

1. To retrieve the data from the JSON file `fetch()`can be used. 
    - An example is shown below. 

2. DOM manipulation is then used to insert the data into the web page.

![Fetch Example](/assets/img/fetch.png)

### What is `fetch()`?

<br>

***fetch()***-[MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/fetch "fetch()") provides the following definition: "The global `fetch()` method starts the process of fetching a resource from the network, returning a promise which is fulfilled once the response is available."
    - This method is used to make asynchronous requests

***Asynchronous***-allows other code to run while the request is being made 

### 3 States of A Promise

- ***Pending***-initial state, before the promise is resolved or rejected
- ***Fulfilled***-completed 
- ***Rejected***-failed
